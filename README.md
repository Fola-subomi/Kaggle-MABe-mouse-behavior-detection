# Kaggle-MABe-mouse-behavior-detection
I decided to attempt training a model for a kaggle competion, not with the intention of actually participating (because I joined so close to the date of conclusion), but because I thought it would be pretty cool to train a model that detects mouse behaviours; they are interesting creatures. I should stop blabbing. The info on the project is coming soon
